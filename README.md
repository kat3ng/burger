- **For:** Northwestern Coding Bootcamp
- **Developer:** Kat Eng
- **Deployment Date** 12/21/2018

## Description & Requirements

For this assignment I built a full-stack burger logging app that takes user input and interaction with the DOM to manipulate information in the database.  


## How it Works

 The app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
