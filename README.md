# Week 14: Burger => A Burger Logging App!
- **For:** Northwestern Coding Bootcamp
- **Developer:** Kat Eng
- **Deployment Date** 12/21/2018
- **Built With** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Express, Node.js, mySQL, jawsDB


## Description & Requirements

For this assignment I built a full-stack burger logging app that takes user input and interaction with the DOM to manipulate information in the database.

## How it Works

 1. The app uses HTML, CSS and Handlebars as a framework for the front end design and behavior. 
 
 2. The middleware, aka the routes and the ORM dictate where and how the app interacts with the mySQL database.
 
 
 ## Notes
 This app is currently at a 90% done status, where I was able to connect the database and get the HTML displayed. While users can add burgers to the datbase, they are not able to remove them at the moment.  I will probably take time in the next few weeks to work through this.
